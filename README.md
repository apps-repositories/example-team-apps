# example-team-apps

This is a sample repository for the apps repo architecture showing a team called
example as well as their apps.

The example prefix is assigned to the team, so namespaces starting with `example-`
are reserved for the team.

This repo attempts to use the `nono-` prefix for the team, but it is not allowed
since it is not an assigned prefix.
